## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **SpecOrca**, please
report it responsibly. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, email the maintainers directly or use GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
feature on this repository.

Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept.
- The version(s) of SpecOrca affected.

## Response timeline

- **Acknowledgement** within 3 business days.
- **Assessment and fix** as soon as practical; we aim to release a patch within
  14 days for confirmed vulnerabilities.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |

## Scope

This policy covers the SpecOrca Python package (`spec_orca`) and its default

please report issues with those to their respective maintainers.
